A score of 1 = an inability to complete the item and a score of 5 = no difficulty experienced at all. Summative scores are generated for each domain. Domain scores range from 0-100. The Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is scored in the following way, for each domain: Transformed Scale = [(Actual raw score - lowest possible raw score) / Possible raw score range] x 100 Three items in the emotion domain, 3f, 3h, and 3i, are reverse-scored, i.e., 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, 3 remains the same, 4 becomes 2, and 5 becomes 1, prior to manual calculation. For these items, use the following equation to compute the individual's score: 6 - individual's rating = item score The last item assesses the participant's overall perception of recovery and is presented in the form of a visual analog scale from 0 to 100, where 0 = "no recovery" and 100 = "full recovery."

Except where indicated, the patient should not be coached (i.e., repeated requests to patient to make a special effort).													
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_level_of_consciousness	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	1a.  Level of Consciousness: The investigator must choose a response if a full evaluation is prevented by such obstacles as an endotracheal tube, language barrier, orotracheal trauma/bandages. A 3 is scored only if the patient makes no movement (other than reflexive posturing) in response to noxious stimulation.	0, Alert; keenly responsive. | 1, Not alert; but arousable by minor stimulation to obey, answer, or respond. | 2, Not alert; requires repeated stimulation to attend, or is obtunded and requires strong or painful stimulation to make movements (not stereotyped). | 3, Responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects or totally unresponsive, flaccid, and areflexic.												
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_loc_questions	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	1b.  LOC Questions: The patient is asked the month and his/her age. The answer must be correct - there is no partial credit for being close. Aphasic and stuporous patients who do not comprehend the questions will score 2. Patients unable to speak because of endotracheal intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from any cause, language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to aphasia are given a 1. It is important that only the initial answer be graded and that the examiner not help" the patient with verbal or non-verbal cues."	0, Answers both questions correctly. | 1, Answers one question correctly. | 2, Answers neither question correctly.												
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_loc_commands	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	1c.  LOC Commands: The patient is asked to open and close the eyes and then to grip and release the non-paretic hand. Substitute another one step command if the hands cannot be used. Credit is given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to weakness. If the patient does not respond to command, the task should be demonstrated to him or her (pantomime), and the result scored (i.e., follows none, one or two commands). Patients with trauma, amputation, or other physical impediments should be given suitable one-step commands. Only the first attempt is scored.	0, Performs both tasks correctly. | 1, Performs one task correctly. | 2, Performs neither task correctly.												
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_best_gaze	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	2.  Best Gaze: Only horizontal eye movements will be tested. Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be scored, but caloric testing is not done. If the patient has a conjugate deviation of the eyes that can be overcome by voluntary or reflexive activity, the score will be 1. If a patient has an isolated peripheral nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI), score a 1. Gaze is testable in all aphasic patients. Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-existing blindness, or other disorder of visual acuity or fields should be tested with reflexive movements, and a choice made by the investigator. Establishing eye contact and then moving about the patient from side to side will occasionally clarify the presence of a partial gaze palsy.	0, Normal. | 1, Partial gaze palsy; gaze is abnormal in one or both eyes, but forced deviation or total gaze paresis is not present. | 2, Forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not overcome by the oculocephalic maneuver.												
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_visual	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	3.  Visual: Visual fields (upper and lower quadrants) are tested by confrontation, using finger counting or visual threat, as appropriate. Patients may be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal. If there is unilateral blindness or enucleation, visual fields in the remaining eye are scored. Score 1 only if a clear-cut asymmetry, including quadrantanopia, is found. If patient is blind from any cause, score 3. Double simultaneous stimulation is performed at this point. If there is extinction, patient receives a 1, and the results are used to respond to item 11.	0, No visual loss. | 1, Partial hemianopia. | 2, Complete hemianopia. | 3, Bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness).												
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_facial_palsy	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	4.  Facial Palsy: Ask - or use pantomime to encourage - the patient to show teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes. Score symmetry of grimace in response to noxious stimuli in the poorly responsive or non-comprehending patient.

strokeimpactoutcomeadult_sensory	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	8.  Sensory: Sensation or grimace to pinprick when tested, or withdrawal from noxious stimulus in the obtunded or aphasic patient. Only sensory loss attributed to stroke is scored as abnormal and the examiner should test as many body areas (arms [not hands], legs, trunk, face) as needed to accurately check for hemisensory loss. A score of 2, 'severe or total sensory loss', should only be given when a severe or total loss of sensation can be clearly demonstrated. Stuporous and aphasic patients will, therefore, probably score 1 or 0. The patient with brainstem stroke who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2. If the patient does not respond and is quadriplegic, score 2. Patients in a coma (item 1a=3) are automatically given a 2 on this item.	0, Normal; no sensory loss. | 1, Mild-to-moderate sensory loss; patient feels pinprick is less sharp or is dull on the affected side; or there is a loss of superficial pain with pinprick, but patient is aware of being touched. | 2, Severe to total sensory loss; patient is not aware of being touched in the face, arm, and leg.												
strokeimpactoutcomeadult_best_language	quality_of_life_and_care		radio	9.  Best Language: A great deal of information about comprehension will be obtained during the preceding sections of the examination. For this scale item, the patient is asked to describe what is happening in the attached picture, to name the items on the attached naming sheet and to read from the attached list of sentences. Comprehension is judged from responses here, as well as to all of the commands in the preceding general neurological exam. If visual loss interferes with the tests, ask the patient to identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech. The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in a coma (item 1a=3) will automatically score 3 on this item. The examiner must choose a score for the patient with stupor or limited cooperation, but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is mute and follows no one-step commands.	0, No aphasia; normal. | 1, Mild-to-moderate aphasia; some obvious loss of fluency or facility of comprehension, without significant limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression.Reduction of speech and/or comprehension, however, makes conversation about provided materials difficult or impossible. For example, in conversation about provided materials, examiner can identify picture or naming card content from patient?s response. | 2, Severe aphasia; all communication is through fragmentary expression; great need for inference, questioning, and guessing by the listener. Range of information that can be exchanged is limited; listener carries burden of communication. Examiner cannot identify materials provided from patient response. | 3, Mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or auditory comprehension.

If the patient has severe aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be rated. Only if the patient is intubated or has other physical barriers to producing speech, the examiner should record the score as untestable (UN), and clearly write an explanation for this choice. Do not tell the patient why he or she is being tested.	0, Normal. | 1, Mild-to-moderate dysarthria; patient slurs at least some words and, at worst, can be understood with some difficulty. | 2, Severe dysarthria; patient's speech is so slurred as to be unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric. | 3, UN, Intubated or other physical barrier, explain below

Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect): Sufficient information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior testing. If the patient has a severe visual loss preventing visual double simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are normal, the score is normal. If the patient has aphasia but does appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal. The presence of visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as evidence of abnormality. Since the abnormality is scored only if present, the item is never untestable.	0, No abnormality. | 1, Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattention or extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one of the sensory modalities. | 2, Profound hemi-inattention or extinction to more than one modality; does not recognize own hand or orients to only one side of space.

info_821001	quality_of_life_and_care	Trans Cranial Doppler Ultrasonography (TCD) (PhenX protocol PX0821001 unless stated otherwise)	descriptive	Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography Identifying Intracranial Landmarks and Major Cerebral Arteries Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography provides visual landmarks to help correctly identify intracranial blood vessels. Correct identification of intracranial vessels relies on the diameter of the head, position of the transducer, angle of the transducer, depth of the Doppler sample, and direction of the blood flow. In adults, the diameter of the head is assumed to be 130-140 mm, whereas the head diameter must be measured due to variation of children's head sizes. In children, the bitemporal diameter is measured so that the location of the midline can be calculated (half of the diameter of the head). The internal carotid artery (ICA) bifurcation is the landmark that is the reference point for all other intracranial anatomy. The depth of the ICA bifurcation is estimated to usually be 10 to12 millimeters shallower than the midline. Recording Transcranial Doppler Ultrasonography Results The results of the TCD are spectral waveform plots of velocity vs. time and the calculated velocity is the time averaged mean of the maximum velocity. Examiners should record the highest time-averaged mean blood-flow velocity in 2-millimeter increments in the following arteries: *middle cerebral artery (at three points), *distal internal carotid artery, *anterior and posterior cerebral arteries, and *basilar artery.

Angle-corrected mean velocities can be obtained by automatic or manual tracing of the Doppler waveform. Uncorrected flow velocities are calculated for each artery as the product of angle-corrected velocities and the cosine of the recorded angle of insonation based on the Doppler equation.

This method is referred to as simple scoring because the scores from each of the items are simply added up without recoding or collapsing of response categories; thus, there is no weighting of individual items. This approach is practical to use as a hand-scoring approach and may be the method of choice in busy clinical settings or in paper-pencil interview situations. As a result, the simple sum of the scores of the items across all domains constitutes a statistic that is sufficient to describe the degree of functional limitations. Complex: The more complex method of scoring is called "item-response-theory" (IRT)-based scoring. It takes into account multiple levels of difficulty for each WHODAS 2.0 item. It takes the coding for each item response as "none," "mild," "moderate," "severe," and "extreme" separately and then uses an algorithm to determine the summary score by differentially weighting the items and the levels of severity. The SPSS algorithm is available from WHO. The scoring has three steps: ? Step 1 - Summing of recoded item scores within each domain. ? Step 2 - Summing of all six domain scores. ? Step 3 - Converting the summary score into a metric ranging from 0 to 100 (where 0 = no disability; 100 = full disability).		PX0610102

strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_level_of_consciousness	phenotype	Pediatric NIH stroke scale (pednihss)	radio	1a.  Level of Consciousness:  the investigator must choose a response, even if a full evaluation is prevented by such obstacles as an endotracheal tube, language barrier, orotracheal trauma/bandages. A 3 is scored only if the patient makes no movement (other than reflexive posturing) in response to noxious stimulation.	0, 0 - Alert; keenly responsive. | 1, 1 - Not alert, but arousable by minor stimulation to obey, answer, or respond. | 2, 2 - Not alert, requires repeated stimulation to attend, or is obtunded and requires strong or painful stimulation to make movements (not stereotyped). | 3, 3 - Responds only with reflex motor or autonomic effects or totally unresponsive, flaccid, areflexic.	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_loc_questions	phenotype		radio	1b.  LOC Questions: The patient is asked the month and his/her age. The answer must be correct - there is no partial credit for being close. Aphasic and stuporous patients who do not comprehend the questions will score 2. Patients unable to speak because of endotracheal intubation, orotracheal trauma, severe dysarthria from any cause, language barrier, or any other problem not secondary to aphasia are given a 1. It is important that only the initial answer be graded and that the examiner not "help" the patient with verbal or non-verbal cues. Modified for children  age 2 years and up. A familiar Family Member must be present for this item: Ask the child 'how old are you'  Or 'How many years old are you?' for question number one. Give credit if the child states the correct age.	0, 0 - Answers both questions correctly. | 1, 1 - Answers one question correctly. | 2, 2 - Answers neither question correctly.	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_loc_commands	phenotype		radio	1c.  LOC Commands: The patient is asked to open and close the eyes and then to grip and release the non-paretic hand. For children one may substitute the command to grip the hand with the command 'show me your nose' or 'touch your nose'. Substitute another one step command if the hands cannot be used. Credit is given if an unequivocal attempt is made but not completed due to weakness. If the patient does not respond to command, the task should be demonstrated to them (pantomime) and score the result (i.e., follows none, one or two commands). Patients with trauma, amputation, or other physical impediments should be given suitable one-step commands. Only the first attempt is scored.	0, 0 - Performs both tasks correctly | 1, 1 - Performs one task correctly | 2, 2 - Performs neither task correctly	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_best_gaze	phenotype		radio	2.  Best Gaze: Only horizontal eye movements will be tested. Voluntary or reflexive (oculocephalic) eye movements will be scored but caloric testing is not done. If the patient has a conjugate deviation of the eyes that can be overcome by voluntary or reflexive activity, the score will be 1. If a patient has an isolated peripheral nerve paresis (CN III, IV or VI) score a 1. Gaze is testable in all aphasic patients. Patients with ocular trauma, bandages, pre-existing blindness or other disorder of visual acuity or fields should be tested with reflexive movements and a choice made by the investigator. Establishing eye contact and then moving about the patient from side to side will occasionally clarify the presence of a partial gaze palsy.	0, 0 - Normal | 1, 1 - Partial gaze palsy. This score is given when gaze is abnormal in one or both eyes, but where forced deviation or total gaze paresis are not present. | 2, 2 - Forced deviation, or total gaze paresis not overcome by the oculocephalic maneuver.	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_visual	phenotype		radio	3.  Visual: Visual fields (upper and lower quadrants) are tested by confrontation, using finger counting (for children > 6 years) or visual threat (for children age 2 to 6 years) as appropriate. Patient must be encouraged, but if they look at the side of the moving fingers appropriately, this can be scored as normal. If there is unilateral blindness or enucleation, visual fields in the remaining eye are scored.  Score 1 only if a clear-cut asymmetry, including quadrantanopia is found. If patient is blind from any cause score 3. Double simultaneous stimulation is performed at this point. If there is extinction patient receives a 1 and the results are used to answer question 11.	0, 0 - No visual loss | 1, 1 - Partial hemianopia | 2, 2 - Complete hemianopia | 3, 3 - Bilateral hemianopia (blind including cortical blindness)	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_facial_palsy	phenotype		radio	4.  Facial Palsy: Ask, or use pantomime to encourage the patient to show teeth or raise eyebrows and close eyes. Score symmetry of grimace in response to noxious stimuli in the poorly responsive or non-comprehending patient. If facial trauma/bandages, orotracheal tube, tape or other physical barrier obscures the face, these should be removed to the extent possible.	0, Normal symmetrical movement | 1, Minor paralysis (flattened nasolabial fold, asymmetry on smiling) | 2, Partial paralysis (total or near total paralysis of lower face) | 3, Complete paralysis of one or both sides (absence of facial movement in the upper and lower face)	PX0820802

Motor Arm and Leg: LEFT ARM - The limb is placed in the appropriate position: extend the arms (palms down) 90 degrees (if sitting) or 45 degrees (if supine) and the leg 30 degrees (always tested supine). Drift is scored if the arm falls before 10 seconds or the leg before 5 seconds. For children too immature to follow precise directions or uncooperative for any reason, power in each limb should be graded by observation of spontaneous or elicited movement according to the same grading scheme, excluding the time limits. The aphasic patient is encouraged using urgency in the voice and pantomime but not noxious stimulation. Each limb is tested in turn, beginning with the non-paretic arm. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion at the shoulder or hip, or immobilization by an IV board, may the score be 9 and the examiner must clearly write the explanation for scoring as a 9. Score each limb separately.	0, 0 - No drift, limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees for full 10 seconds. | 1, 1 - Drift, Limb holds 90 (or 45) degrees, but drifts down before full 10 seconds; does not hit bed or other support. | 2, 2 - Some effort against gravity, limb cannot get to or maintain (if cued) 90 (or 45) degrees, drifts down to bed, but has some effort against gravity. | 3, 3 - No effort against gravity, limb falls. | 4, 4 - No movement | 9, 9 - Amputation, joint fusion explain below:	PX0820802

strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_limb_ataxia	phenotype		radio	7.  Limb Ataxia: This item is aimed at finding evidence of a unilateral cerebellar lesion. Test with eyes open. In case of visual defect, insure testing is done in intact visual field. The finger-nose-finger and heel-shin tests are performed on both sides, and ataxia is scored only if present out of proportion to weakness. In children, substitute this task with reaching for a toy for the upper extremity, and kicking a toy or the examiner?s hand, in children too young (< 5 years) or otherwise uncooperative for the standard exam item. Ataxia is absent in the patient who cannot understand or is paralyzed. Only in the case of amputation or joint fusion may the item be scored 9  and the examiner must clearly write the explanation for not scoring. In case of blindness test by touching nose from extended arm position.	0, 0 - Absent | 1, 1 - Present in one limb | 2, 2 - Present in two limbs	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_sensory	phenotype		radio	8.  Sensory: Sensation or grimace to pin prick when tested, or withdrawal from noxious stimulus in the obtunded or aphasic patient. For children too young or otherwise uncooperative for reporting gradations of sensory loss, observe for any behavioral response to pin prick, and score it according to the same scoring scheme as a 'normal' response, 'mildly diminished' or 'severely diminished' response. Only sensory loss attributed to stroke is scored as abnormal and the examiner should test as many body areas [arms (not hands), legs, trunk, face] as needed to accurately check for hemisensory loss. A score of 2, severe or total  should only be given when a severe or total loss of sensation can be clearly demonstrated.  Stuporous and aphasic patients will therefore probably score 1 or 0.	1, 1 - Normal; no sensory loss. | 2, 2 - Mild to moderate sensory loss; patient feels pinprick is less sharp or is dull on the affected side; or there is a loss of superficial pain with pinprick but patient is aware he/she is being touched. | 3, 3 - Severe to total sensory loss; patient is not aware of being touched in the face, arm, and leg.	PX0820802											
strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_best_language	phenotype		radio	9.  Best Language: A great deal of information about comprehension will be obtained during the preceding sections of the examination. For children age 6 years and up with normal language development before onset of stroke: The patient is asked to describe what is happening in the attached picture , to name the items on the attached naming sheet, to repeat words from the attached list, and to read from the attached list of sentences (Table S1; Fig S1, S2, S3). Comprehension is judged from responses here as well as to all of the commands in the preceding general neurological exam. If visual loss interferes with the tests, ask the patient to identify objects placed in the hand, repeat, and produce speech.  The intubated patient should be asked to write. The patient in coma (question 1a=3) will arbitrarily score 3 on this item. The examiner must choose a score in the patient with stupor or limited cooperation but a score of 3 should be used only if the patient is mute and follows no one step commands. For children age 2 yrs to 6 yrs (or older children with premorbid language skills < 6 yr level), score this item based on observations of language comprehension and speech during the examination. The patient with brain stem stroke who has bilateral loss of sensation is scored 2. If the patient does not respond and is quadriplegic score 2. Patients in coma (item 1a=3) are arbitrarily given a 2 on this item.	0, 0 - No aphasia, normal | 1, 1 - Mild to moderate aphasia; some obvious loss of fluency or facility of comprehension, without significant limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression. Reduction of speech and/or comprehension, however, makes conversation about provided material difficult or impossible. For example in conversation about provided materials examiner can identify picture or naming card from patient's response. | 2, 2 - Severe aphasia; all communication is through fragmentary expression; great need for inference, questioning, and guessing by the listener. Range of information that can be exchanged is limited; listener carries burden of communication. Examiner cannot identify materials provided from patient response. | 3, 3 - Mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or auditory comprehension.	PX0820802

If the patient has severe aphasia, the clarity of articulation of spontaneous speech can be rated. Only if the patient is intubated or has other physical barrier to producing speech, may the item be scored '9' and the examiner must clearly write an explanation for not scoring. Do not tell the patient why he/she is being tested.	0, 0 - Normal | 1, 1 - Mild to moderate; patient slurs at least some words and, at worst, can be understood with some difficulty. | 2, 2 - Severe; patient's speech is so slurred as to be unintelligible in the absence of or out of proportion to any dysphasia, or is mute/anarthric. | 9, 9 - Intubated or other physical barrier, explain below:	PX0820802

strokeimpactoutcomepediatrics_extinction_inattention_neglect	phenotype		radio	11.  Extinction and Inattention (formerly Neglect): Sufficient information to identify neglect may be obtained during the prior testing. If the patient has a severe visual loss preventing visual double simultaneous stimulation, and the cutaneous stimuli are normal, the score is normal. If the patient has aphasia but does appear to attend to both sides, the score is normal. The presence of visual spatial neglect or anosagnosia may also be taken as evidence of abnormality. Since the abnormality is scored only if present, the item is never untestable.	0, 0 - No abnormality. | 1, 1 - Visual, tactile, auditory, spatial, or personal inattention or extinction to bilateral simultaneous stimulation in one of the sensory modalities. | 2, 2 - Profound hemi-inattention or hemi-inattention to more than one modality. Does not recognize own hand or orients to only one side of space.	PX0820802

scoring_130501	phenotype		descriptive	Scoring Instructions In Lipton et al. (2001), respondents were classified as suffering from migraine if they fulfill the criteria for migraine with aura and migraine without aura established in 1998 by the International Headache Society (IHS) (Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society, 1998). This included one or more severe headache in the last year with "unilateral or pulsatile pain, and either nausea, vomiting, or phonophobia with photophobia; or visual or sensory aura before the headache" (Lipton et al., 2001). These criteria were updated by the International Headache Society in 2004 (Headache Classification Subcommittee of the International Headache Society, 2004).
