# Mapping script
## map data elements from SPACRCo sites to the Sickle in Afrcia standardised element set

please find attached in a zipped file containing the python code performing the harmonization of data sets from different sites, migrating these data sets to new variables in the SADaCC harmonized dictionary. The code is run as follows:

python DataMigrationCodeFinal14April.py SCDRegistry_DATA_2018-11-02_1657.csv MappingFile1.tsv SADaCCVariables.tsv

Different test files are included in the zip file and the code itself should run in any platform and for any python version and dependency needed.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or comments, or if you get any bug.

With best regards,

Gaston
